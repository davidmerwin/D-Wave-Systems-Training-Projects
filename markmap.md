# Mind Map: Quantum Lagrangian Simulation

## Mathematical Expression

- **Classical Lagrangian**
  - Captures the dynamics of the system.
  - Involves an electromagnetic wave and qubits.

## Python3 Script

- **Simulation of Lagrangian System**
  - Solves a simplified version of the Lagrangian system using Python.
  - Simulates the evolution of $$\Phi_n$$ over time.

### Constants

- $$c$$ (Speed of light)
- $$L$$ (Inductance)
- $$n_{\text{points}}$$ (Number of qubits)

### State Initialization

- $$\Phi_n$$, $$\dot{\Phi}_n$$, $$\Psi_n$$, $$\dot{\Psi}_n$$

### Time Evolution Parameters

- $$dt$$ (Time step)
- $$time_{\text{steps}}$$ (Number of time steps)

### Lagrangian Terms Computation

- Kinetic term: $$\left(\frac{{\dot{\Phi}_n}}{{2c}}\right)^2$$
- Potential term: $$\frac{{(\Phi_n - \Phi_{n-1} - \tilde{\Psi}_n)^2}}{{2L}}$$

### Update of $$\Phi$$ and $$\Psi$$ based on Dynamics

- Update $$\dot{\Phi}_n$$ by adding random noise
- Update $$\Phi_n$$ and $$\Psi_n$$ based on their derivatives

### Storage of History for Plotting

- Store the values of $$\Phi_n$$ at each time step

### Plotting

- Plot the evolution of $$\Phi_n$$ over time
