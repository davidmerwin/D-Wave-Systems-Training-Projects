Exercise 2
To run the exercise 2 demo from the command-line, type the command:
python two_different.py
In this exercise, we want to penalize the two qubit solutions in which the qubits have the same values; we want to favor the two qubit solutions in which the qubits have different values.

In the results; you should notice that the solutions $(0.1)$ and $(10)$ have lower energy than the solutions $(0$ ) and (1 1).
