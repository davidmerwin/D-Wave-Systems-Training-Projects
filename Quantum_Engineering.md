Progress in experimental techniques and theoretical modeling has made it possible to fabricate and test macroscopic structures which use quantum coherent solid state qubits as building blocks. The results of this quantum engineering are likely to go far beyond the limited goals of quantum computing and quantum communication and may provide a direct way to explore the quantumclassical boundary. Some recent developments are discussed. (c) 2010 American Institute of Physics. [doi:10.1063/1.3515522]

The miniaturization of electronic devices to the point where quantum effects must be taken into account produced much of the momentum behind nanotechnology, together with the need to better understand and control matter on the molecular level

the term “mesoscopic physics,” especially with respect to solid state devices, meaning that these objects exist on an intermediate scale between truly microscopic single atoms or small molecules and truly macroscopic. Despite their comparatively large size 10 –10 particles, mesoscopic systems maintain enough quantum coherence to make quan- tum effects really important 

The physical aspects of research on quantum computing are guided by DiVincenzo’s criteria:
1. A scalable physical system with well characterized qubits.
2. The ability to initialize the state of the qubits to a simple ﬁducial state, such as |000….
3. Long relevant decoherence times, much longer than the gate operation time.
4. A “universal” set of quantum gates.
5. A qubit-speciﬁc measurement capability.
