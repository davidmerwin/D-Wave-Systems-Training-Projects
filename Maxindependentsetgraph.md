### Code Annotations

#### Importing Libraries
1. **networkx**: This library helps you create and manipulate complex networks. 

   ```python
   import networkx as nx
   ```
  
2. **dwave_networkx**: This is D-Wave's extension of NetworkX for graph algorithms suitable for D-Wave machines.

   ```python
   import dwave_networkx as dnx
   ```
  
3. **dwave.system**: It provides the D-Wave QPU solver interface.

   ```python
   from dwave.system import DWaveSampler, EmbeddingComposite
   ```
  
4. **matplotlib**: To visualize the graphs.
  
   ```python
   import matplotlib
   matplotlib.use("agg")
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   ```

#### Functions
1. **get_token**: Placeholder function to return your access token. Tokens are used for authorized access to D-Wave solvers.

   ```python
   def get_token():
       'Return your personal access token.'
       # TODO: Enter your token here
       return
   ```

2. **set_sampler**: Placeholder function for setting up the solver, which is not fully implemented in your snippet.

#### Other Annotations
- **Problems** and **Leap IDE**: These look like directions or comments related to your IDE setup.
- **Maximum independent set size found is 3**: Output that indicates the solution to your problem, with a maximum independent set \([2,5,7]\).

### Graph Problem Translation
The maximum independent set size found is 3, and the set \( S = \{2,5,7\} \).
To translate this back to the antenna problem, you could say that antennas placed at positions 2, 5, and 7 are optimally spaced 
such that they are independent of each other, possibly minimizing interference or maximizing coverage.

### Python Code Relevance to Mathematical Model

In the mathematical model for finding a maximum independent set, you could represent the problem as:

\[
\text{Maximize } Z = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i
\]
subject to 
\[
x_i + x_j \leq 1, \; \forall \; (i, j) \in E
\]
Where \( Z \) is the size of the independent set, \( x_i \) is a binary variable representing whether vertex \( i \) is part of the independent set or not, and \( E \) is the set of edges.

Your D-Wave implementation aims to solve this mathematical optimization problem using quantum annealing, and the solution is then 
interpreted back in the context of the original problem (e.g., antenna placement).
